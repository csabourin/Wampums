# Email Draft: Introduction to Scouts Canada

**Subject:** Wampums: A Modern, Bilingual Alternative for Scout Group Management — Demo Available

---

Bonjour / Hello,

My name is [Your Name], and I'm the developer behind **Wampums** (https://wampums.app) — a bilingual (FR/EN) web and mobile platform built specifically for managing Scout groups in Canada.

I'm reaching out because I believe Wampums addresses several operational gaps that existing tools don't cover, and I'd like to invite your team to explore a live demo.

## What Makes Wampums Different

Most tools available to Scout leaders focus on badge tracking. Wampums does that, but it also handles the operational work that consumes leaders' time every week:

- **Online Parent Payments** — Parents pay fees directly through the app via Stripe (credit card, no cash-chasing). Leaders see real-time outstanding balances, payment breakdowns by method, and can export financial reports.

- **Carpool Coordination** — A dedicated system where parents offer rides, leaders assign participants, and everyone sees who's driving whom. No more group chat chaos before every outing.

- **WhatsApp, Email, and Google Chat Integration** — Send announcements to parents from a single interface through the channel they actually use. No separate mailing list to maintain.

- **Digital Permission Slips** — Create, send, and track permission forms electronically. Parents sign via a secure link on their phone. Leaders see who has and hasn't signed at a glance.

- **Equipment Inventory** — Catalog equipment with photos, track storage locations, and reserve gear for upcoming activities with conflict detection.

- **Full Bilingual Support** — Every screen, every notification, every form works natively in both French and English. The interface also supports Ukrainian, Italian, and Indonesian for diverse communities.

- **Mobile App** — A native iOS/Android app (Expo/React Native) alongside the web app. Leaders can take attendance at a campsite with no laptop needed.

- **Badge and Honor Tracking** — Multi-level star system with approval workflows, bulk operations, and progress dashboards. Supports Castors through Routiers / Beavers through Rovers.

## What I'm Asking

I'd welcome the opportunity to walk your team through a **live demo** at https://demo.wampums.app. The demo includes read-only admin and parent accounts so you can see both perspectives.

I'm also open to discussing:
- Pilot programs with a few groups to gather real-world feedback
- Integration possibilities with Scouts Canada's existing systems
- Any specific needs or pain points your member groups have raised

Wampums is actively used and under continuous development. I'm a Canadian developer building this for the Canadian scouting community, and I'd value Scouts Canada's perspective on where it could serve your members best.

I'm happy to schedule a video call at your convenience, or you're welcome to explore the demo at any time.

Merci / Thank you,

## Notes on Tailoring This Email

**Before sending, consider:**

1. **Find the right contact.** Scouts Canada's national office has a Digital/IT team and a Partnership team. LinkedIn or their staff directory may help identify the right person. A warm introduction through a Group Commissioner who already uses Wampums would be far more effective than a cold email.

2. **Lead with a problem they know about.** If you've heard specific complaints from leaders (e.g., "we spend more time on admin than programming"), reference that directly. "I've heard from leaders in [District] that..." is more compelling than a feature list.

3. **Don't position against ScoutsTracker explicitly.** Scouts Canada may have a relationship with them. Position Wampums as "complementary" or "a different approach" rather than "better than what you currently endorse."

4. **Offer a pilot, not a contract.** Lower the barrier. "Try it with 3 groups for a season" is easier to say yes to than "switch your endorsed platform."

5. **Mention the languages.** Bilingual capability is not optional for a national Canadian organization. The fact that Wampums is natively bilingual (not translated as an afterthought) is a genuine advantage.

6. **Attach a one-pager.** Consider creating a single-page PDF with screenshots showing: parent payment flow, carpool dashboard, permission slip signing, and badge tracker. Visual proof is more persuasive than text descriptions.

7. **Follow up in French.** If your first email is in English, send the follow-up in French (or vice versa). It demonstrates the bilingual capability organically.
