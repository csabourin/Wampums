**Subject:** Wampums — A Complete, Bilingual Platform for Running Scout Groups (Live Demo Available)

---

Bonjour / Hello,

My name is Christian Sabourin, and I'm the developer behind **Wampums** (https://wampums.app) — a bilingual web and mobile platform built specifically for managing Scout groups in Canada. It supports all sections from Castors/Beavers through Routiers/Rovers.

I'm reaching out because leaders spend too much of their volunteer time on administration instead of programming. Wampums handles the full operational cycle — from weekly meeting prep to year-end reporting — so leaders can focus on the kids. I'd like to invite your team to explore a live demo.

## What Wampums Covers

### Weekly Meeting Preparation
- **AI-Assisted Meeting Plans** — Generate meeting plans with activities, responsible leaders, and required materials. Load previous meetings as templates. Built-in risk analysis for safety planning.
- **Upcoming Meeting View** — At-a-glance display of the next meeting with date, time, location, and assigned activities.
- **Meeting Reminders** — Automatic parent reminders before each meeting.

### On-the-Ground Tracking
- **Attendance** — Mobile-friendly attendance tracking with guest support. Take attendance at a campsite with no laptop needed.
- **Medication Management** — Track medication requirements for each participant, schedule dispensing windows with time-based alerts, and record distribution events. Pulls data from health forms automatically.
- **Points & Honors** — Award points by group or individual. Manage honors with date tracking, undo window, and sortable views.
- **Badge Tracking** — Multi-level star/badge system with approval workflows (pending, approved, delivered), bulk delivery operations, and progress dashboards.

### Parent Experience
- **Parent Dashboard** — Parents see their children's activities, badge progress, upcoming events, and outstanding documents in one place.
- **Online Payments** — Parents pay fees directly via Stripe (credit card). Leaders see real-time balances. No more collecting cash or chasing cheques.
- **Permission Slips** — Create, email, and track permission forms electronically. Parents sign via a secure link on their phone. Leaders see who has and hasn't signed at a glance.
- **Health Forms** — Digital health/medical forms (fiche de santé) with emergency contact sections, submitted and updated online.
- **Carpool Coordination** — Parents offer rides, leaders assign participants, everyone sees who's driving whom. Quick-access modal shows all upcoming activities with vehicle/seat counts.
- **Parent Contact Directory** — Searchable contact list so parents can reach each other directly.

### Finance & Fundraising
- **Fee Management** — Define membership fees, assign to participants, create payment plans with schedules.
- **Expense Tracking** — Record and categorize expenses with payment method tracking.
- **Budget Management** — Plan budgets by category with tracking against actuals.
- **Fundraiser Management** — Create and manage fundraisers with calendar views, archiving, and per-participant sales tracking.
- **External Revenue** — Track revenue from sources outside regular fees.
- **Revenue Dashboard** — Consolidated view across all revenue sources with fiscal year support.
- **Financial Reports** — Reporting on billings, payments, outstanding balances, and payment method breakdowns.

### Communication
- **WhatsApp Integration** — Connect via QR code, send group announcements directly through WhatsApp with real-time delivery status.
- **Email & Mailing Lists** — Role-based mailing lists with templates and an announcement composer.
- **Google Chat Integration** — Configure Google Chat spaces for automated notifications.
- **News Feed** — Dashboard news aggregation for group-wide updates.

### Equipment & Resources
- **Inventory Management** — Catalog equipment with photos (auto-optimized), track storage locations (scout hall, warehouse, leader's home), and manage condition.
- **Material Reservations** — Reserve equipment for upcoming activities with automatic conflict detection for overlapping bookings.
- **Resource Dashboard** — At-a-glance view of what's reserved for each meeting date.

### Participant & Group Management
- **Dynamic Registration Forms** — Customizable registration forms built with a drag-and-drop form builder. Supports conditional logic, translations, and copying forms between units.
- **Group Management** — Organize participants into dens/patrols/groups with leader assignments.
- **Guardian Management** — Parent/guardian relationship tracking with participant linking and approval workflows.
- **Participant Documents** — Centralized view of all forms, health records, and permission slips per participant.
- **SISC Data Import** — Import participants, guardians, and users from CSV.

### Reporting

### Administration & Multi-Unit Management

### Technical

- **Native Mobile App** — iOS and Android via Expo/React Native, with secure credential storage and offline capability.
- **Progressive Web App** — Installable from the browser with service worker caching and offline support.
- **AI Features** — AI-powered meeting plan generation and receipt parsing for expense entry.
- **Offline Support** — Critical data cached locally. Attendance and write operations queued and synced when connection returns.
- **Security** — JWT authentication, 256-bit SSL, input sanitization, parameterized queries, rate limiting, CSP headers, and role-based access control.

## What I'm Asking

I'd welcome the opportunity to walk your team through a **live demo** at https://demo.wampums.app. The demo includes read-only admin and parent accounts so you can see both perspectives — the leader managing a meeting, and the parent checking their child's progress and paying fees.

I'm also open to discussing:
- **Pilot programs** with a few groups for a season to gather real-world feedback
- **Integration possibilities** with Scouts Canada's existing systems (MyScouts, etc.)
- **Specific pain points** your member groups have raised that we could address

Wampums is actively used and under continuous development. I'm a Canadian developer building this for the Canadian scouting community, and I'd value Scouts Canada's perspective on where it could serve your members best.

I'm happy to schedule a video call at your convenience, or you're welcome to explore the demo at any time.

Merci / Thank you,

Christian Sabourin

## Notes on Tailoring This Email

**Before sending, consider:**

1. **Find the right contact.** Scouts Canada's national office has a Digital/IT team and a Partnership team. LinkedIn or their staff directory may help identify the right person. A warm introduction through a Group Commissioner who already uses Wampums would be far more effective than a cold email.

2. **Lead with a problem they know about.** If you've heard specific complaints from leaders (e.g., "we spend more time on admin than programming"), reference that directly. "I've heard from leaders in [District] that..." is more compelling than a feature list.

3. **Don't position against ScoutsTracker explicitly.** Scouts Canada may have a relationship with them. Position Wampums as "complementary" or "a different approach" rather than "better than what you currently endorse."

4. **Offer a pilot, not a contract.** Lower the barrier. "Try it with 3 groups for a season" is easier to say yes to than "switch your endorsed platform."

5. **Mention the languages.** Bilingual capability is not optional for a national Canadian organization. The fact that Wampums is natively bilingual (not translated as an afterthought) is a genuine advantage.

6. **Attach a one-pager.** Consider creating a single-page PDF with screenshots showing: parent payment flow, carpool dashboard, permission slip signing, medication management, meeting prep with AI, and badge tracker. Visual proof is more persuasive than text descriptions.

7. **Follow up in French.** If your first email is in English, send the follow-up in French (or vice versa). It demonstrates the bilingual capability organically.

8. **Consider the length.** This email is comprehensive. For the first contact, you may want to send a shorter version (just the opening paragraph, 3-4 headline features, and the demo link) with a line like "Full feature overview available on request." Then share the full list during a follow-up call or as a PDF attachment.

9. **Highlight what ScoutsTracker doesn't do** (without naming them). The features that stand out as unique are: online Stripe payments, WhatsApp integration, carpool coordination, medication management with timed alerts, AI-assisted meeting plans, and receipt parsing. No competing tool in this space offers all of these.
