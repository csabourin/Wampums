    <h1>Wampums vs Scouts Digital: Beyond Advancement Tracking</h1>
    <p>Scouts Digital is the official advancement platform for Scouts Canada members. It does what it's designed to do — track badge requirements, store advancement records, and connect to the national registry. But running a scout group involves considerably more than advancement tracking. This page explains what Scouts Digital handles well, where it stops, and how Wampums fills the operational gaps that every group leader encounters every week.</p>

        <h2>Advancement vs Full Group Operations</h2>
        <p>Scouts Digital excels at one thing: tracking badge advancement within the Scouts Canada framework. It provides a structured way to record requirement completions, connect to national badge records, and give leaders visibility into each youth's progression through the program. For that specific job, it is the right tool and the official one.</p>
        <p>What Scouts Digital does not do is run the group. Weekly attendance, carpool coordination for families driving across town to meetings, equipment sign-out and tracking, parent communication that reaches every family in their preferred language, financial management for dues and camp fees, medication tracking for overnight trips, permission slips for every activity — this is the work that happens every single week regardless of whether any badges are being earned. Wampums handles this full operational layer so leaders can spend their energy on the program rather than on administration.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Bilingual Communication Built In</h2>
        <p>Scouts Digital operates in English and French as interface languages, but it does not provide per-family language switching for communications sent to parents. In a mixed English/French group — common across Canada, and the norm in many communities — leaders must either manage two separate communication flows manually or accept that some families will receive messages in the wrong language. Neither outcome is acceptable when you are trying to maintain engagement with every family in the group.</p>
        <p>Wampums stores a language preference for every user and uses it automatically for everything the platform generates. A French-speaking parent receives meeting reminders, permission slips, and financial statements in French. Their English-speaking co-parent receives the same communications in English. The leader who set up the activity sees it in English. There is no manual workflow, no separate French mailing list, and no risk of the wrong language reaching the wrong family. This is the standard that bilingual Canadian groups need, and it is built into Wampums at the foundational level.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Offline Operation for Remote Camps</h2>
        <p>Scouts Digital requires internet access for most functions. This limitation is acceptable for weekly meetings in a community hall, but it becomes a serious operational problem at camp. Canadian scout camps are often in locations with no cellular coverage — provincial parks, wilderness areas, and remote waterfront sites where the whole point is to be away from connected infrastructure. At those locations, a platform that requires a server connection cannot be used for the purposes that matter most: taking attendance, checking medical records, logging medication dispensing, and verifying emergency contacts.</p>
        <p>Wampums works fully offline for attendance, points, badge logging, and medication dispensing for up to 10 days. Camp mode pre-loads all participant data — rosters, medical information, medication schedules, carpool assignments, and emergency contacts — onto the leader's device before departure. At camp, every critical record is available without any network connection. Changes and logs are queued locally and sync automatically when the group returns to connectivity. Leaders do not need to think about signal; the platform handles it.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Parent Engagement and Communication</h2>
        <p>Scouts Digital has limited parent-facing features. Parents can view their child's advancement records, which is useful, but the platform was not designed as a communication hub between leaders and families. Meeting reminders, activity announcements, payment requests, permission slip collection, and event updates all happen outside Scouts Digital — typically through a mix of email threads, group chats, and paper forms that are difficult to track and easy to miss.</p>
        <p>Wampums provides a full parent portal where families can view their child's attendance history, badge progress, upcoming events, and financial statements — all in their preferred language. Leaders send targeted communications through the platform rather than managing separate contact lists. Parents receive bilingual notifications for meetings, upcoming deadlines, and permission slips through push notifications, email, or WhatsApp depending on their preference. The result is a single, traceable communication record that replaces the scattered mix of channels that most groups currently manage.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Financial Management and Fundraising</h2>
        <p>Scouts Digital does not include any financial management capability. Group finances — annual dues, camp fees, equipment purchases, fundraising proceeds, and grant tracking — are handled entirely outside the platform, typically in a spreadsheet maintained by a volunteer treasurer who may change from year to year. When the treasurer changes, financial history is often lost or inaccessible. When groups need to report to provincial or municipal funders, they are assembling records from multiple sources rather than exporting from a single system.</p>
        <p>Wampums includes full budget tracking, expense management, fee collection, bank reconciliation, and a dedicated fundraising module with per-participant sales tracking. All financial records are attached to the organization, not to an individual volunteer's spreadsheet. Leaders can see the current financial position at any time, generate statements for funders, and track outstanding payments from families. The fundraising module tracks who sold what, which matters for groups running cookie sales, bottle drives, or other per-participant campaigns. One platform — no separate spreadsheet, no manual reconciliation of e-transfer records.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Works for All Canadian Youth Organizations</h2>
        <p>Scouts Digital is specific to Scouts Canada membership. Organizations outside the Scouts Canada structure — Girl Guides chapters, Air and Sea Cadet corps, 4-H clubs, cultural youth organizations, and independent youth programs — have no access to Scouts Digital and no path to getting its advancement tracking functionality. Every non-Scouts Canada group starts from scratch, typically with a combination of spreadsheets and generic tools that were not designed for youth group management at all.</p>
        <p>Wampums works for any Canadian youth group without requiring affiliation to any national organization. The configurable badge system supports Girl Guides' advancement framework, Cadet training levels, or any completely custom program structure that a group defines. All other features — attendance, bilingual communications, offline camps, parent portal, finance, medications, carpool, permission slips — work identically regardless of organizational type. A Scouts Canada group and a community cultural youth program get the same full-featured platform, and both can manage all their operations in one place.</p>
