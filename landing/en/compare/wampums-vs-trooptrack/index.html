    <h1>Wampums vs TroopTrack: Why Canadian Scout Groups Choose Wampums</h1>
    <p>TroopTrack is a long-standing scout management platform with a solid feature set — for American groups. It was built for the Boy Scouts of America system, operates under US data privacy standards, and is English-only throughout. For a Canadian scout group serving families in Quebec, New Brunswick, Northern Ontario, or any other bilingual community, these limitations are not minor inconveniences — they are fundamental mismatches with the operational reality of running a Canadian youth organization. This comparison walks through the six most important differences between TroopTrack and Wampums for Canadian groups.</p>

        <h2>French Language Support — Built In, Not Bolted On</h2>
        <p>TroopTrack is an English-only platform. There is no French interface, no French notification templates, and no per-user language preference. For a Canadian scout group with Francophone families — which describes virtually every group in Quebec, Acadian communities, Franco-Ontarian groups, and mixed-language urban groups across the country — this means parents receive communications in a language that is not their own. That is both a practical failure and, in many organizational contexts, a legal and equity concern.</p>
        <p>Wampums was designed from the first line of code for bilingual Canadian groups. Every interface element, every notification template, every form, and every report is available in both English and French. Each user — leader or parent — sets a language preference during onboarding. From that point forward, the platform delivers a fully French or fully English experience based on their preference. A French-speaking parent and an English-speaking leader can look at the same meeting and see everything in their own language. No workarounds, no manual translation step, no communication in the wrong language.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Canadian Privacy Law: PIPEDA vs US Standards</h2>
        <p>TroopTrack stores data in the United States under US data privacy frameworks. Canadian organizations that collect personal information about children — which every scout group does — are subject to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) at the federal level and additional legislation in provinces including Quebec (Law 25), Alberta (PIPA), and British Columbia (PIPA). Using a US-based platform that is not specifically designed for Canadian requirements creates compliance exposure that volunteer leaders are rarely equipped to manage.</p>
        <p>Wampums stores all data on Canadian servers. The platform is designed with PIPEDA compliance as a core requirement, not an afterthought. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Role-based access controls ensure that only authorized leaders and parents can access each participant's information. The platform includes data export and deletion tools that organizations need to respond to access and correction requests under Canadian privacy law. For groups in Quebec operating under the stricter requirements of Law 25, Wampums provides a data-residency foundation that a US platform cannot.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Scout Canada and Girl Guides Canada Compatibility</h2>
        <p>TroopTrack is built around the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) badge and rank system. The terminology, progression frameworks, and achievement structures all reflect the BSA model. Canadian scout groups following Scout Canada's Path program, Scouts Quebec's frameworks, or Girl Guides Canada's badge progression will find that TroopTrack's structures simply don't map to how Canadian organizations actually work. Customizing an American platform to fit Canadian frameworks is a significant technical and administrative burden.</p>
        <p>Wampums is built for Canadian organizations. The badge and achievement tracking module uses terminology and structures appropriate for Scout Canada sections — Beavers, Cubs, Scouts, Venturers, and Rovers — and for Girl Guides Canada. New achievement frameworks can be configured by administrators without requiring custom development. The platform speaks Canadian scouting, which means leaders spend their time running programs instead of fighting with software that doesn't understand their organization.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Offline Capability for Canadian Camps and Remote Locations</h2>
        <p>Canada has a lot of wilderness. Scout groups regularly run camps in provincial parks, Crown land, and remote locations where cellular data is unavailable and WiFi does not exist. TroopTrack, as a traditional web application, requires an active internet connection for most functionality. Leaders at a remote camp lose access to attendance records, medication schedules, emergency contacts, and carpool assignments the moment they drive out of cell range.</p>
        <p>Wampums is built offline-first. Before heading to a camp or remote event, the app caches all critical data to the leader's device — participant roster, medical information, medication schedules, emergency contacts, and carpool assignments. Every action taken without internet is queued locally and synced when connectivity returns. A leader at a campsite in Algonquin Park can take morning attendance, log medication dispensing, and look up a parent's emergency number without a data connection. This offline capability is architectural, not a workaround, and it works across all modules simultaneously.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Local Support That Understands Canadian Scouting</h2>
        <p>TroopTrack's support team is based in the United States and is most familiar with BSA processes, terminology, and the regulatory environment of American youth organizations. When a Canadian group leader needs help understanding how to set up their group's financial reporting for a provincial grant, or how to configure bilingual notification templates for a mixed-language group in New Brunswick, support from a team with no Canadian context is limited in its usefulness.</p>
        <p>Wampums is built and supported by a team that understands Canadian scouting. Support is available in both English and French. The team is familiar with Scout Canada's organizational structure, provincial variations in youth organization regulation, and the practical realities of volunteer leadership in Canadian communities. When you have a question, you reach someone who knows what a Colony meeting looks like and why bilingual parent communication matters. That context makes support interactions faster and more useful.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>All-Inclusive Pricing for Volunteer Organizations</h2>
        <p>TroopTrack offers tiered pricing that can become significant for larger groups or groups that need access to all modules. For a volunteer-led scout group whose annual budget may be a few thousand dollars in total, paying a recurring software subscription that increases with group size or feature requirements is a real constraint. Budget discussions at the group committee level take time and energy that could be spent on program delivery.</p>
        <p>Wampums is free during early access for qualifying Canadian scout and youth organizations. Every module — attendance, badge tracking, finance, forms, medications, carpool, and communications — is included at no cost. There is no tiered pricing, no per-participant charges, and no feature gates. The goal is to ensure that every Canadian scout group, from a small rural Beaver colony to a large urban district, has access to the same professional-grade tools regardless of their financial resources. Request a demo to confirm eligibility and get your group set up.</p>
