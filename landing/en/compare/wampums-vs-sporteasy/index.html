    <h1>Wampums vs Sporteasy: Scouting-Specific vs General Sports Management</h1>
    <p>Sporteasy is a well-regarded platform for managing sports teams — scheduling matches, tracking rosters, and communicating with players and parents. But running a scout group is not the same as running a hockey team. Scouts have badge progressions, overnight camps, bilingual families, permission slips, medication tracking, and a volunteer leadership structure that looks nothing like a coaching staff. This comparison explains exactly where a general sports management app falls short for scout and youth groups, and why Wampums — built from the ground up for this specific use case — is a better fit for Canadian organizations.</p>

        <h2>Native Bilingual Support for Canadian Families</h2>
        <p>Canada's scout movement is bilingual. A single group often includes families where some parents are most comfortable in English and others in French. Sporteasy is a European platform with partial French translation, but it is not designed for the per-user language switching that Canadian mixed-language groups require. Sending a meeting reminder in the wrong language — or mixing languages on a single form — creates friction and signals to parents that the technology wasn't built for them.</p>
        <p>Wampums stores a language preference for every user. When a French-speaking parent logs in, they see the entire application in French — navigation, notifications, forms, and reports. When an English-speaking leader logs in, they see everything in English. There is no manual toggling, no separate French communication workflow, and no risk of sending English-only reminders to Francophone families. The bilingual experience is automatic and complete.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Badge and Achievement Tracking Built In</h2>
        <p>Badge progression is central to the scouting experience. From Beaver challenges to Scout Canada's Path program, every youth has a set of requirements to complete over weeks, months, or years. Sporteasy has no concept of badge tracking — it manages sports statistics like goals scored and games played, which have nothing to do with scouting achievement frameworks.</p>
        <p>Wampums provides structured badge and achievement records for each participant. Leaders check off requirements from a predefined list; the platform maintains a completion history with dates and the name of the verifying leader. Parents can view their child's progress in their own language. When a scout earns a badge, the record is permanent and travels with them through leadership transitions. No spreadsheets, no binders — just a clear, structured record in the platform.</p>

        <h2>Scout-Specific Workflows: Permission Slips, Medications, and Overnight Camps</h2>
        <p>A typical scout season includes day hikes, overnight camps, and special events — each requiring parent consent, emergency contacts, and often medication information. Sporteasy's event management is built around scheduling games and tracking RSVPs, not collecting medical forms and managing on-site medication dispensing logs.</p>
        <p>Wampums includes purpose-built workflows for each of these scout realities. The form builder handles consent forms, medical declarations, and emergency contact collection with e-signature support. The medications module tracks what each participant is taking, dosage schedules, and dispensing records — all with the detail a camp director needs and all in compliance with the parent's language preference. These are not features bolted onto a sports platform; they are native to how Wampums was designed.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Offline Mode for Camps and Remote Locations</h2>
        <p>Scout meetings happen in community halls with unreliable WiFi. Camps happen in provincial parks with no cell signal. Sporteasy is a connected web application — when you lose internet, you lose functionality. Marking attendance, reviewing medication schedules, or checking which parent is picking up which child becomes impossible when the app requires a live server connection.</p>
        <p>Wampums is built offline-first. Critical data — participant rosters, medical information, medication schedules, attendance sheets, and carpool assignments — is cached locally on the leader's device. Changes made without internet are queued and sync automatically when connectivity returns. A leader at a remote campsite can take attendance, log a medication dispensing, and check emergency contacts without ever needing a signal. This is not an afterthought feature; it is a core architectural decision that shapes how the entire platform works.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Canadian Data Privacy (PIPEDA) Compliance</h2>
        <p>Scout groups collect sensitive data about children — medical information, emergency contacts, photos, and behavioral notes. Canadian organizations are subject to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and, in some provinces, additional provincial privacy legislation. Storing this data with a platform whose servers are located outside Canada, or that is not designed with Canadian legal requirements in mind, creates compliance risk that volunteer leaders rarely have the expertise to assess.</p>
        <p>Wampums stores all data on Canadian servers and is designed with PIPEDA compliance as a foundational requirement. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest, access is role-based, and the platform includes data retention and deletion tools that organizations need to respond to access requests. For Scout Canada and Girl Guides Canada groups operating under provincial charter, Wampums provides the compliance foundation that a general European sports platform cannot match.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Cost and Value for Volunteer-Led Organizations</h2>
        <p>Sporteasy charges per team per month, with pricing structured around the sports team model. For a scout group that needs attendance tracking, badge management, parent communication, permission slips, finance, medications, and carpool coordination, the cost of trying to piece together these workflows in a sports-focused platform — or paying for multiple tools — adds up quickly. Volunteer organizations with tight budgets need tools that deliver value without requiring budget committee approval every year.</p>
        <p>Wampums is free during early access for qualifying Canadian scout and youth organizations. All modules — attendance, badges, finance, forms, medications, carpool, and communications — are included. There are no per-module upsells and no feature gates that require upgrading to a higher tier. The goal is to remove the cost barrier entirely so that every group, regardless of size or budget, can access professional-grade management tools.</p>
