    <h1>Wampums vs Spreadsheets for Scout Group Management</h1>
    <p>For years, volunteer scout leaders have managed rosters, attendance, badge progress, finances, and parent communications inside a tangle of Google Sheets, Excel workbooks, and shared drives. It works — until it doesn't. When the person who built the master spreadsheet steps down, when the formula breaks, when two leaders edit at the same time, or when a parent asks a question you can't answer without opening four different tabs — the cracks start to show. This page compares Wampums, a purpose-built scout management platform, against the spreadsheet approach across every major dimension of running a group.</p>

        <h2>Mobile Attendance That Actually Works in the Field</h2>
        <p>A spreadsheet on a phone is a frustration exercise. You zoom in, accidentally tap the wrong cell, lose your place when a parent asks a question, and spend five minutes finding the right row. Wampums is built specifically for the five minutes between scouts arriving and the meeting starting — a full-screen roster with large tap targets, alphabetical sort, and a search bar that narrows the list as you type.</p>
        <p>Even more importantly, Wampums works when you have no internet. At a campsite, a community hall with spotty WiFi, or an outdoor park, the app queues every action locally and syncs automatically the moment connectivity returns. You never lose data and you never need to ask "did that save?" — the sync indicator tells you exactly where you stand.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Badge Tracking Without the Formula Headaches</h2>
        <p>Tracking badge progress in a spreadsheet means building a matrix of participants versus requirements, maintaining formulas that flag incomplete rows, and manually updating it every time a scout completes a new element. When a leader leaves and takes their spreadsheet knowledge with them, badge records often become orphaned and unreliable.</p>
        <p>Wampums stores badge records in a structured database tied to each participant. Requirements are predefined — leaders check off completions from a list instead of maintaining a formula. Progress is visible per participant and per badge, and historical records survive leadership transitions because they live in the platform, not someone's personal Drive folder.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>True Bilingual Support — Not Two Versions of Everything</h2>
        <p>In Canada, many scout groups include families whose primary language is French and families whose primary language is English. Managing this in a spreadsheet means either building separate English and French versions of every document — doubling your workload — or accepting a mixed-language experience that confuses parents.</p>
        <p>Wampums is bilingual at the data layer. Each user sets a language preference, and the entire interface — navigation, notifications, forms, and reports — renders in their chosen language automatically. A French-speaking parent receives their permission slip request in French. An English-speaking leader sees the same data in English. One platform, one dataset, no duplication.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Permission Slips and Digital Forms Without the Paper Chase</h2>
        <p>The classic scout-group workflow for a permission slip: create a Word document, convert to PDF, email to parents, wait, email reminders to the non-responders, collect paper forms at the door, file them somewhere safe (sometimes), and then manually update a tracking spreadsheet. Every step is manual and every step is a failure point.</p>
        <p>Wampums replaces this entire chain with a built-in form builder. Leaders create the form once, attach it to an activity, and parents complete it on their phone — in their language — with an electronic signature. The platform tracks who has and hasn't responded, sends automatic reminders, and surfaces outstanding forms at the top of the leader's dashboard. No paper, no email threads, no separate tracking sheet.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Integrated Finance — Fees, Expenses, and Budgets Together</h2>
        <p>Scout groups collect membership fees, activity fees, and camp deposits. They pay for equipment, venue rentals, and badges. In a spreadsheet world this means a "fees collected" tab, an "expenses" tab, maybe a "budget" tab, and someone manually reconciling them at year end. Errors creep in because the tabs don't talk to each other automatically.</p>
        <p>Wampums handles the full financial cycle in one place: fee schedules assigned to participants, payment tracking, expense submission with receipt capture, budget categories, and a live dashboard showing the group's financial position. Year-end reports are generated in one click — no reconciliation required because everything was entered in the same system from the start.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Role-Based Access — No More "Don't Touch the Yellow Columns"</h2>
        <p>Spreadsheet access control is binary: you either have the file or you don't. Granting a parent view-only access to their child's information means sharing the entire spreadsheet, then hoping they don't accidentally edit something — or spending time setting up complex cell-locking that breaks whenever you add a row.</p>
        <p>Wampums uses role-based permissions that reflect how scout groups actually work. Parents see their own child's profile, attendance, and outstanding forms. Section leaders see their section's roster and can mark attendance. Group administrators see financial reports and manage users. Nobody sees what they shouldn't, and no cell-locking gymnastics are required. When a new volunteer joins, you assign them a role and they immediately see exactly the right information for their responsibilities.</p>
