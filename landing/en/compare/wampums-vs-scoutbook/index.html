    <h1>Wampums vs Scoutbook: Purpose-Built for Canada's Bilingual Scout Groups</h1>
    <p>Scoutbook is the official digital platform for Scouts BSA, the American scouting organization. It does many things well for US troops. But Canada's scout landscape is fundamentally different — bilingual families, provincial privacy laws, a mix of Scouts Canada, Guides, Cadets, and independent youth organizations, and cultural expectations around French-language services that Scoutbook was simply not designed to meet. This comparison explains the key differences and why Canadian groups increasingly choose Wampums.</p>

        <h2>Built for Canada, Not Translated for It</h2>
        <p>Scoutbook is an American product that has been made available to Canadian users, but availability is not the same as fit. The badge programs reflect BSA's specific merit badge structure, the privacy assumptions are shaped by US law, and the bilingual support amounts to a UI language toggle rather than a genuine per-family experience. Canadian groups end up working around these limitations rather than being served by the tool.</p>
        <p>Wampums was built from scratch for the Canadian bilingual context. Every notification, form, and report is available in English or French, and the language is set per user — not per account and not as a global toggle. A French-speaking parent receives a French consent form while their group's English-speaking leader sees the same record in English. This is not a translation layer applied after the fact; it is how the platform fundamentally works. The difference is felt in every interaction.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Badge Programs Beyond BSA Merit Badges</h2>
        <p>Scoutbook's badge and advancement system was designed around BSA's specific merit badge structure — a list of requirements and counselors that works well for American troops but does not map cleanly onto Scouts Canada's Path program, Girl Guides' badge framework, Cadet training levels, or the advancement systems used by independent Canadian youth organizations. Canadian leaders using Scoutbook often find themselves maintaining parallel records outside the platform to track what actually matters to their group.</p>
        <p>Wampums supports fully configurable badge programs that match your specific organization. Define your own badge categories, levels, and prerequisites. Whether you follow Scouts Canada's structure, Filles Guides requirements, Air Cadet training progressions, or a completely custom framework for a heritage or cultural youth program, Wampums accommodates it. Leaders build the structure once, and the system tracks every participant's progress against that structure indefinitely.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Canadian Data Privacy — Not US Servers</h2>
        <p>Scoutbook stores data on US servers under American law. For most American Scout troops, this raises no concerns. For Canadian organizations, it creates a material compliance gap. Provincial school boards, recipients of municipal or provincial funding, and organizations operating under Quebec's Law 25 are subject to requirements that specify where personal data about minors may be stored and how it must be protected. Storing that data on US infrastructure is not a theoretical risk — it is a compliance failure waiting to be discovered at audit time.</p>
        <p>Wampums stores all data on Canadian servers and is designed for PIPEDA compliance as a foundational requirement. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest. The platform includes access controls, audit logging, and the data retention and deletion tools that organizations need to respond to access requests under applicable privacy legislation. For groups that handle sensitive information about children — medical records, behavioral notes, emergency contacts, attendance history — this is not an optional consideration.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Offline Camp Mode — No WiFi Required</h2>
        <p>Scoutbook requires internet connectivity for most functions. This works acceptably in suburban community halls with reliable WiFi. It fails entirely at a scout camp in Algonquin Park, a provincial wilderness area, or any of the hundreds of remote Canadian camping locations where LTE coverage is non-existent and satellite connectivity is a luxury most groups cannot afford. At the exact moment that accurate medical records and attendance tracking matter most — overnight and multi-day camps — the platform stops being useful.</p>
        <p>Wampums works fully offline for attendance, badges, points, and medication dispensing for up to 10 days in camp mode. Before departure, camp leaders pre-load all participant data onto their devices. At camp, the full operational record is available without any network connection. Medication dispensing logs are kept locally and timestamped. Attendance is taken normally. When the group returns to connectivity, everything syncs automatically. This was not an afterthought feature — it is a core design requirement that shapes the entire platform architecture.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Medications, Carpool, and Finance Built In</h2>
        <p>Scoutbook focuses on advancement tracking and attendance — the core record-keeping functions of the BSA program. Running a real scout group involves considerably more: collecting and tracking medications for camp, coordinating carpool for families driving across town to weekly meetings, managing permission slips that need to be collected from sixty families, and handling the financial reality of dues, equipment purchases, fundraising, and camp fees. Scoutbook does not address these operational needs, leaving leaders to patch together spreadsheets, group chats, and separate tools.</p>
        <p>Wampums includes all of these as native modules. Secure medication management tracks what each participant is taking, dosage schedules, and creates a dispensing log with timestamps. Carpool coordination matches families to available vehicles for each activity. Digital permission slips and forms are sent, signed, and tracked in-platform with e-signature support. Full financial management includes budget tracking, expense recording, fee collection, and a fundraising module with per-participant sales tracking. One platform — no third-party tools, no scattered records, no manual reconciliation.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>One Platform for All Canadian Youth Organizations</h2>
        <p>Scoutbook is designed specifically for BSA troops and the BSA membership structure. Canadian organizations outside the BSA framework — which includes virtually all Canadian scout and youth groups — are edge cases rather than the intended audience. The platform's assumptions about program structure, membership management, and organizational hierarchy reflect the BSA model and do not map well onto the diversity of Canadian youth organizations.</p>
        <p>Wampums works for any Canadian youth organization. Scouts Canada, Girl Guides, Air Cadets, Sea Cadets, heritage clubs, cultural youth programs, and independent organizations all get the same full-featured bilingual platform. The configurable badge system supports any advancement framework without requiring BSA membership or conformity to BSA program structure. A group migrating from Scoutbook to Wampums does not lose any of its operational capability — it gains the Canadian-specific features that Scoutbook was never designed to provide.</p>
