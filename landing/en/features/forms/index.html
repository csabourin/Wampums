    <h1>Digital Permission Slips &amp; Health Forms — No More Printing, Scanning, or Chasing</h1>
    <p>Every scout leader knows the ritual: print the permission slip, send it home in the backpack, wait, remind the family, wait again, receive a crumpled photocopy two days before the camp, then try to decipher a handwritten emergency contact number. Wampums eliminates every step of that process. Digital forms are issued, completed, e-signed, and tracked entirely within the platform — accessible to parents on their phones and to leaders in a real-time response dashboard, with automatic reminders handling the chasing so you don't have to.</p>

        <h2>Digital Permission Slips with Real-Time Tracking</h2>
        <p>When you create a permission slip in Wampums and assign it to an activity, the system immediately notifies all relevant parents through their preferred communication channel — push notification, email, or WhatsApp. Each parent sees the slip in their Wampums parent portal with the activity details, the deadline, and a prominent call to action. The response — yes, no, or a note from the parent — is recorded instantly and visible to the leader in real time.</p>
        <p>The leader's tracking dashboard shows a progress bar with the current response rate, a colour-coded list of all participants (green for confirmed, yellow for pending, red for declined), and a one-tap option to send a targeted reminder to only the non-responders. Because the system knows exactly which parents have opened the message and which have not yet responded, reminder fatigue is eliminated — families who have already responded are never contacted again about the same form.</p>

        <h2>Health Forms — Allergies, Emergency Contacts &amp; Medications</h2>
        <p>A scout's health form is the most important document a leader carries to any outdoor activity. It contains allergy information, emergency contact numbers, medication instructions, and any relevant medical history the leader needs to know. Paper health forms get lost, become outdated, and are illegible at the worst possible moment. Wampums health forms are stored digitally, linked to the participant's profile, and accessible offline on the leader's device — including at a campsite with no cell signal.</p>
        <p>Health forms prompt parents to enter structured data: known allergies with severity levels, current medications with dosage and administration notes, the family doctor's name and number, and emergency contact priority order. When a form is updated by the parent — for example, when a new allergy is diagnosed — the leader receives a notification and the updated information is immediately available. At camp check-in, the leader can view a health summary card for every participant in the group with a single tap.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Custom Form Builder with Drag-and-Drop Interface</h2>
        <p>Every scout group has unique information needs. A sailing-focused group might need a swim test certification field on its activity permission form. A group that runs service projects might need a volunteer hours tracking form. The Wampums form builder provides a drag-and-drop interface for assembling custom forms from a library of field types: short text, long text, number, date picker, file upload, checkbox, radio button, dropdown, and e-signature. Fields can be reordered, grouped under section headings, and marked as required or optional.</p>
        <p>Each field has a bilingual label — one for English, one for French — defined at build time. The same form definition renders in the parent's language automatically, so you never need to build two separate versions of the same form. Validation rules can be attached to fields: a phone number field can enforce a Canadian format, a date field can block past dates, and a text field can require a minimum character count. Forms can be previewed in both languages before being published to ensure the layout is correct at all screen sizes.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Conditional Logic for Smarter Forms</h2>
        <p>A form that asks every parent the same set of questions regardless of relevance is frustrating and produces noise in the data. Conditional logic in the Wampums form builder means fields appear only when they are needed. For example: show the "medication name and dosage" fields only if the parent answers "yes" to "Does your child require medication during activities?" Show the "swimming ability" field only for water-based activities. Show the "dietary restrictions detail" field only if the parent selects "has dietary restrictions" from a checkbox list.</p>
        <p>Conditional logic is configured visually with "if this field equals this value, then show / hide these fields" rules — no coding required. Rules can reference any field in the form, allowing multi-step branching logic for complex use cases such as medical emergency protocols or consent to photography with specific restrictions. Submitted responses include the full logic state, so leaders reviewing a completed form see only the fields that were relevant to that participant, keeping the review experience clean and efficient.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Registration Forms — Dynamic &amp; Customizable</h2>
        <p>Annual registration is the most complex form workflow a scout group runs. It combines personal information, section selection, health data, media consent, code of conduct acknowledgement, fee payment, and sometimes volunteer interest questionnaires — all in one flow. Wampums registration forms support multi-step layouts that guide parents through each section in sequence, with a progress indicator so they know how much remains to complete.</p>
        <p>Registration forms are dynamic: sections available to a family are determined by the sections with open spots, the participant's age, and any waitlist status. If Beaver Scouts is full, the Beaver section option is either hidden or shown with a waitlist indicator automatically. Partial completions are saved as drafts, so a parent who runs out of time can return to exactly where they left off without re-entering data. Submitted registrations trigger an automatic confirmation email and initiate the fee invoicing flow if online payment is enabled.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Parent Document Portal — All Outstanding Forms in One Place</h2>
        <p>Parents of active scouts face a steady stream of forms throughout the year: registration, health updates, camp permission slips, fundraiser participation, photo consent renewals, and more. Without a central location to track these requests, important forms get missed. Wampums provides each parent with a document portal — a personal dashboard listing every form that has been sent to them, its status (completed, pending, or overdue), and a direct link to complete any outstanding items.</p>
        <p>The portal is accessible from the parent's app home screen and is always current: when a new form is issued, it appears immediately. Completed forms are archived and viewable for reference. Parents can download a PDF copy of any completed form for their own records. The portal also shows which forms are approaching their deadline, surfacing the most urgent items at the top of the list. This dramatically reduces the number of "I didn't know I had a form to complete" conversations at the start of a meeting.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Cross-Unit Form Sharing &amp; Year-to-Year Templates</h2>
        <p>Large scout organizations — groups, districts, councils — have multiple units running similar programs with similar paperwork needs. Building a new health form for each unit from scratch wastes time and introduces inconsistencies. Wampums allows form templates to be shared across units within an organization. An administrator can create a standard health form or code-of-conduct form at the organization level and make it available to all unit leaders as a starting template that they can use as-is or customize for their specific needs.</p>
        <p>Year-to-year duplication prevents the annual rebuild. When a new scouting year begins, a leader selects any form from the previous year and duplicates it with a single tap. The duplicate retains all fields, conditions, and bilingual labels, but resets all response data and allows the leader to update the activity dates, deadlines, and any changed details before republishing. This pattern is especially valuable for annual registration forms, which change only slightly from year to year but are time-consuming to rebuild from scratch.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>E-Signature &amp; Legal Consent Tracking</h2>
        <p>An e-signature on a Wampums form is legally equivalent to a handwritten signature in Canadian jurisdictions that recognize electronic signatures under the Uniform Electronic Commerce Act and provincial equivalents. When a parent completes and signs a form, Wampums records the signature timestamp, the IP address of the device used, and the content of the form at the time of signing. This audit trail is stored securely and retrievable for the duration of the retention period configured by your organization.</p>
        <p>For activities with elevated risk — overnight camps, water activities, travel outside the local area — forms can require an explicit consent checkbox in addition to the e-signature, ensuring the parent has acknowledged the specific risk disclosure language. If a form's content is updated after some parents have already signed — for example, when the activity location changes — the system detects the change and re-notifies affected parents to review and re-confirm the updated version, preventing outdated consents from standing for changed conditions.</p>
