    <h1>Scout Badge &amp; Honor Tracking — Replace Binder Logs With a Living Digital Record</h1>
    <p>Every binder has a story: pages that fall out, pencil marks that smudge, entries from three leaders ago that nobody can decipher. Wampums replaces the binder with a structured digital system where every badge, honor, and point is logged, approved, and visible to the right people at the right time.</p>

        <h2>Multi-Level Badge System</h2>
        <p>Wampums supports a configurable multi-level star and badge system that adapts to your organization's advancement program. Define badge categories (e.g., skill, service, adventure), assign prerequisites, and group badges by program year or section level.</p>
        <p>Each badge can have multiple achievement levels, allowing scouts to progress incrementally. The system tracks which level each scout has reached and what remains for the next level — visible to both leaders and parents at a glance.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Three-Stage Approval Workflow</h2>
        <p>The approval process mirrors how scouting actually works. When a scout earns a badge, a leader marks it <strong>Pending</strong>. After verification (a test, a presentation, or a committee review), it moves to <strong>Approved</strong>. Once the physical badge is handed out at a ceremony, it becomes <strong>Delivered</strong>.</p>
        <p>Every status transition is timestamped and attributed to the leader who made the change, creating a complete audit trail. Bulk operations let you advance multiple scouts at once — ideal for ceremony nights when 12 badges are awarded at the same time.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Points System</h2>
        <p>Award points for participation, achievements, good conduct, or any criteria your group uses. Points can be assigned by group or individually, with sortable views to see rankings. Leaders can add or deduct points with a reason note, keeping the history transparent.</p>
        <p>Points sync offline — you can award points at a campfire with no connection and they'll sync when you're back in range. The optimistic update system means the scout sees their new total immediately, with no confusing delays.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Parent Visibility</h2>
        <p>Parents see their child's badge progress in their dashboard — which badges are earned, which are pending approval, and which are delivered. This eliminates the common situation where a parent doesn't know their child earned a badge until the physical item comes home weeks later.</p>
        <p>Progress is displayed with visual indicators: a progress bar toward the next level, a checklist of completed requirements, and a history of awarded badges with dates. Parents can filter by badge category and print a progress summary for their records.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Program Progress Reports</h2>
        <p>Generate per-participant progress reports that cover attendance, badges, honors, and points over any time period. Reports can be shared with parents, used for council submissions, or printed for end-of-year ceremonies.</p>
        <p>Group-level reports show which badges are most commonly earned, which requirements are bottlenecks, and which scouts are advancing fastest. This data helps leaders identify where program adjustments might help struggling participants.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Compatible with Any Scouting Organization</h2>
        <p>Wampums does not lock you into a specific badge program. It works for Scouts Canada, Girl Guides, Air Cadets, Sea Cadets, Pathfinders, or any youth group with a structured advancement program. Configure your own badge categories, names, and levels through the admin panel — no coding required.</p>
        <p>Groups that run bilingual programming can define badge names in both English and French. Each participant sees badge names in their preferred language.</p>
