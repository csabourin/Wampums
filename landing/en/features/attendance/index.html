    <h1>Mobile Scout Attendance Tracking — No Paper, No Hassle</h1>
    <p>Imagine it's Tuesday evening, your scouts are arriving two minutes apart, it's raining, and someone just dropped the clipboard. Sound familiar? Wampums turns attendance from a paperwork chore into a one-tap action on your phone — even when you have no internet connection.</p>

    <div class="actions">
      <a class="btn-primary" href="mailto:hello@wampums.app">Request a demo</a>

        <h2>One-Tap Mobile Attendance</h2>
        <p>Open the app, select the meeting, and tap each scout's name to mark them present. The roster is pre-populated from your participant list, sorted alphabetically or by group. Absent participants are highlighted so you never miss anyone.</p>
        <p>The interface is designed for real-world conditions: large tap targets work with gloves, the screen is readable in sunlight, and no scrolling is required for groups of up to 30. For larger groups, a quick search filter narrows the list instantly.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Offline-First Architecture</h2>
        <p>Wampums uses optimistic updates: when you tap to mark attendance, the change appears immediately in the UI — even if your connection drops mid-session. All actions are queued locally and sync automatically when connectivity returns.</p>
        <p>This is especially valuable at campsites, outdoor venues, and community centres with poor WiFi. You'll never lose attendance data because the network was unreliable. The sync indicator tells you exactly when data has been confirmed server-side.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Guest Participant Support</h2>
        <p>When a friend joins for a meeting, you can add them as a guest directly from the attendance screen without creating a full participant profile. Guest entries appear in the attendance record for that session only. This keeps your main roster clean while ensuring accurate meeting counts.</p>
        <p>If the guest becomes a regular, you can convert them to a full participant in one step, preserving their historical attendance data.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Automatic Bilingual Reminders</h2>
        <p>Before each meeting, Wampums sends reminders to parents in their preferred language — English or French — with meeting details, outstanding permission slips, and anything else they need to bring. This reduces no-shows and last-minute "what time is it again?" messages.</p>
        <p>Reminders go out via push notification, email, or WhatsApp depending on the parent's communication preferences. Leaders can customize the timing: 48 hours before, 24 hours before, or both.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Attendance History & Trends</h2>
        <p>Every attendance session is stored and searchable. View per-participant history to identify patterns — which scouts miss consecutive meetings, who has perfect attendance, and which dates had unusually low turnout.</p>
        <p>Export attendance reports for council submissions, grant applications, or end-of-year reviews. Reports include group totals, individual records, and period-over-period comparisons in CSV or printable format.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Integration with Badges & Finance</h2>
        <p>Attendance data flows automatically into badge tracking and financial reporting. Minimum attendance requirements for certain badges are checked automatically. Fee calculations that depend on attendance (e.g., activity-specific charges) are updated in real time.</p>
        <p>Leaders spend less time cross-referencing spreadsheets and more time running programs. Everything stays in sync within one platform.</p>
