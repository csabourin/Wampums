    <h1>Scout Fundraiser Management — From Cookie Sales to Annual Campaigns</h1>
    <p>Scout fundraising runs on enthusiasm, not spreadsheets — but at some point someone has to track who sold what, how much came in, and whether you hit the target. Wampums replaces the paper tally sheets and disconnected Google Docs with a structured fundraiser module that covers everything from creating the campaign to archiving the final report, and feeds the results directly into your financial dashboard.</p>

        <h2>Fundraiser Creation — Name, Target, Dates, Products</h2>
        <p>Creating a new fundraiser takes under two minutes. Set a name, a monetary target, a start and end date, and add the products or items being sold. Products can include descriptions, unit prices, and minimum order quantities. The fundraiser is then visible to leaders immediately and can be shared with participants and parents through the notification system.</p>
        <p>Multiple product types within a single fundraiser are supported — useful for campaigns that sell both a physical item and tickets, or offer options at different price points. Product catalogues from previous years can be duplicated and updated rather than rebuilt from scratch, saving setup time for recurring annual campaigns.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Participant Tracking — Assign Scouts and Track Sales per Person</h2>
        <p>Once a fundraiser is created, leaders assign participating scouts from the group roster. Each participant gets their own sales record where leaders or parents can log orders received, items delivered, and payments collected. The system supports both full group participation and selective enrollment for fundraisers where only certain sections are involved.</p>
        <p>Individual sales totals update in real time as entries are made. Leaders can see at a glance which scouts are active sellers, who has not yet entered any sales, and who has reached or exceeded their personal target. This makes it easy to follow up with specific participants without reviewing an entire spreadsheet.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Calendar View — Plan Multiple Fundraisers Without Overlap</h2>
        <p>Most scout groups run several fundraisers across the year — a fall campaign, a holiday sale, a spring event. The calendar view shows all active and upcoming fundraisers on a timeline, making scheduling conflicts obvious before they become problems. Leaders can see at a glance whether two campaigns overlap and adjust dates accordingly.</p>
        <p>The calendar also shows key milestones such as order deadlines, delivery dates, and payment collection cutoffs. These milestones can be converted into group reminders with one click, sending automatic notifications to participating families in their preferred language. Planning a full fundraising year becomes a visual exercise rather than a spreadsheet exercise.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Progress Dashboard — Total vs. Target</h2>
        <p>The fundraiser dashboard shows the overall campaign progress at a glance: total sales to date, percentage of target reached, number of active participants, and days remaining. A visual progress bar makes the group's collective achievement concrete and motivating for scouts and leaders alike. The dashboard updates in real time as sales are entered.</p>
        <p>Leaders can also view a breakdown by participant, showing individual contributions alongside the group total. Sorting by sales volume identifies top performers and highlights participants who may need encouragement. Downloading a summary report for committee meetings or council submissions requires a single click.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Archive Completed Fundraisers</h2>
        <p>When a fundraiser ends, archiving it removes it from the active view while preserving all records permanently. Archived fundraisers remain searchable and reportable, so year-over-year comparisons are always available. Leaders can pull up last year's cookie campaign to see the final total, the top sellers, and the timeline — valuable context for planning this year's edition.</p>
        <p>The archive also serves as a compliance record. If your group is required to report fundraising income to a parent council or provincial body, the archived fundraiser data provides an accurate, timestamped record of all transactions. Exporting archived data to CSV or PDF is available for any fundraiser in the archive.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Integration with Revenue Dashboard</h2>
        <p>Fundraiser revenue flows directly into Wampums' finance module without any manual entry. Each fundraiser appears as a named revenue line in the group's financial dashboard, and totals are included in period summaries and annual reports. This eliminates the reconciliation step that typically happens after a campaign when someone has to match fundraising totals against the bank balance.</p>
        <p>The integration also supports partial revenue recognition — if a fundraiser spans two fiscal periods, revenue is allocated accordingly. For bilingual groups, all financial reports generated from fundraiser data are available in both English and French, meeting the reporting requirements of Canada's bilingual scouting organizations.</p>
