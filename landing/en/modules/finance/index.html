    <h1>Scout Finance Management — From Membership Fees to Year-End Reports</h1>
    <p>Scout group finances are deceptively complex for a volunteer-run organization. You collect membership fees from families, charge activity-specific amounts, track deposits for camps, reimburse leaders for supply purchases, manage fundraiser revenue and costs, and produce reports for district councils — all with a rotating roster of volunteer treasurers who may or may not have accounting backgrounds. The Wampums finance module handles every part of this cycle in a single bilingual platform, replacing the spreadsheet-and-shoebox-receipts workflow that most groups currently rely on.</p>

        <h2>Membership and Activity Fee Management</h2>
        <p>Define fee schedules once and assign them to participants automatically based on section, age group, or registration status. Wampums tracks which families have paid, which have partial payments outstanding, and which have requested fee assistance — all without requiring the treasurer to maintain a separate spreadsheet. Fee reminders go out automatically in the family's preferred language, reducing the number of follow-up emails the treasurer needs to send manually.</p>
        <p>Activity-specific fees — camp deposits, event charges, equipment contributions — are attached directly to the activity record. When a participant is registered for an activity that has a fee, the charge appears automatically in their financial summary. Leaders and parents see exactly what is owed for each upcoming event, and the treasurer has a consolidated view of all outstanding balances across every participant and every activity in a single dashboard.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Expense Tracking with AI Receipt Parsing</h2>
        <p>The traditional scout expense workflow: a leader buys craft supplies, keeps the receipt in their wallet for two weeks, hands it to the treasurer at the next meeting, the treasurer enters it into a spreadsheet, and files the physical receipt in a folder that will be lost by year end. Every step is manual, error-prone, and slow. Wampums replaces this with a mobile-first expense submission flow that takes under 60 seconds.</p>
        <p>Leaders photograph a receipt immediately after purchase using their phone's camera. Wampums uses AI parsing to extract the merchant name, amount, date, and tax fields automatically — pre-filling the expense form so the leader only needs to select the budget category and tap submit. The receipt image is stored digitally and attached to the expense record permanently. The treasurer receives an instant notification, reviews the submission, and approves or requests clarification — all within the app. No lost receipts, no manual data entry, no two-week delay.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Budget Management by Category and Activity</h2>
        <p>Wampums lets the group treasurer build an annual budget organized by category — supplies, venues, badges, travel, equipment, and any custom categories the group defines. Each budget category has an allocated amount, and every expense submission is assigned to a category when it is approved. The budget dashboard shows remaining allocation per category in real time, so the treasurer knows exactly how much is left for the rest of the year without opening a spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>Budgets can also be created per activity — a summer camp budget, a district jamboree budget, a fundraiser budget — allowing the group to track the financial performance of individual events separately from the operational budget. This is particularly useful for grant reporting, where funders often require per-project financial summaries rather than overall group financials. Wampums generates these project-level reports automatically from the expense and revenue data already in the system.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Fundraiser Management — Revenue and Costs Together</h2>
        <p>Running a fundraiser involves tracking both income and expenses, managing participant involvement (who sold what, who collected money), and producing a net-revenue summary for the group's records. Without a dedicated tool, fundraiser accounting typically lives in a separate spreadsheet that is never quite reconciled with the main group budget. Wampums brings fundraiser management into the same financial platform so nothing falls through the cracks.</p>
        <p>Create a fundraiser record, set the revenue and cost structure, and track contributions by participant and by activity. If the group runs a cookie sale, cap sale, or bottle drive, Wampums records who collected what, reconciles the total against expenses, and shows the net contribution to the group's annual budget. Parents can see their child's participation in fundraisers through the parent dashboard, and the treasurer gets a complete fundraiser report — in English or French — for any district documentation requirements.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Revenue Dashboard — Your Group's Financial Position at a Glance</h2>
        <p>A scout group treasurer should be able to answer "how much money do we have and where did it come from?" without opening multiple spreadsheets or waiting for a monthly reconciliation. Wampums provides a live revenue dashboard that shows total income to date, income by source (fees, fundraisers, grants, donations), outstanding receivables, and total approved expenses — updated every time a transaction is recorded in the platform.</p>
        <p>The dashboard is designed for volunteer treasurers who may not have accounting backgrounds. Financial information is presented in plain language with clear categories, not accounting jargon. Leaders and committee members with appropriate permissions can view the dashboard to stay informed without needing direct access to transaction details. The group can also share a read-only financial summary with district or council administrators for oversight purposes, without exposing individual family fee details.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Financial Reports — Year-End, Grant-Ready, and Bilingual</h2>
        <p>At year end, the Wampums finance module generates a complete financial summary: total income by category, total expenses by category, fundraiser net revenue, outstanding fees, and a transaction-level detail report. These reports can be filtered by date range, budget category, activity, or participant group, and exported in both PDF (for submission to councils and grant bodies) and CSV (for the incoming treasurer to understand the year's activity).</p>
        <p>All financial reports are available in English and French. For groups in bilingual districts or provinces that require French-language documentation, there is no need to manually translate or recreate reports in a second language — the same data generates a properly formatted French report with one click. For grant applications, Wampums can produce project-specific reports that show exactly how grant funds were received and spent, with the transaction detail that funders require for accountability reporting.</p>
