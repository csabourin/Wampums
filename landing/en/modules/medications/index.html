    <h1>Scout Medication Tracking — Safe Dispensing at Every Meeting and Camp</h1>
    <p>When a scout requires daily medication or carries an EpiPen, there is no room for guesswork. Wampums gives your leadership team a complete, secure medication management system — from parental consent forms through to dispensing logs at a remote campsite — so every dose is recorded and every allergy is visible the moment it matters.</p>

        <h2>Medication Profile per Participant</h2>
        <p>Each participant has a dedicated health profile that captures prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, known allergies, emergency contacts, and physician notes. Leaders see a consolidated view when preparing for a meeting or camp, so they know exactly who requires attention before anyone arrives.</p>
        <p>Profiles support multiple medications per participant and allow per-medication instructions such as "take with food," time-of-day restrictions, and special storage requirements. Allergy severity levels are colour-coded so critical information is impossible to overlook at a glance, even in a busy hall or a dark tent.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Dispensing Schedule with Timed Alerts</h2>
        <p>Set up a dispensing schedule for each medication — morning, evening, or specific windows — and Wampums sends timed push notifications to the responsible leader's device. Alerts include the participant's name, medication name, dosage, and any special instructions. No more relying on memory or sticky notes on a clipboard.</p>
        <p>Schedules can be configured per event type: a regular Tuesday evening meeting may have a single dispensing window, while a five-day summer camp can have a full multi-day schedule with different leaders assigned to different shifts. Leaders on duty receive reminders automatically without manual setup for each event.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Dispensing Log — Who Gave What, When, and What Dose</h2>
        <p>Every dispensing event is recorded with a timestamp, the leader's name, the medication given, and the dose. This log is immutable and searchable, creating a complete audit trail for each participant across all events. If a parent or physician asks what was given and when, the answer is available in seconds.</p>
        <p>The log also flags skipped doses or delayed administrations with a reason field, so there is a clear record if a scout refused medication or was absent. Group administrators can export dispensing logs as PDF or CSV for health authorities, council requirements, or insurance purposes.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Camp Mode — Extended Offline Cache</h2>
        <p>Remote camps often have no reliable cellular or WiFi coverage. Camp mode activates an extended 10-day local cache, storing all medication profiles, dispensing schedules, and participant health data directly on each leader's device. The full medication workflow operates without any internet connection throughout the camp.</p>
        <p>Dispensing events logged offline are stored in the mutation queue and sync automatically the moment a connection becomes available — whether that is at the end of each day from the camp office or only at the end of the trip. Nothing is lost, and every event is timestamped accurately at the time it occurred.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Parental Consent and Health Form Integration</h2>
        <p>Wampums connects the medication module directly to the digital forms system. Parents complete health forms and medication consent agreements online before an event, and the data flows automatically into participant health profiles. Leaders see a clear indicator showing which participants have submitted complete health forms and which are still outstanding.</p>
        <p>Form templates are fully bilingual — parents can complete them in English or French — and digital signatures are captured in the platform. This eliminates the stack of paper forms that traditionally gets lost before camp, and ensures consent documentation is stored securely alongside the health profile it covers.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>PIPEDA-Compliant Data Handling</h2>
        <p>Health and medication data is among the most sensitive personal information a youth organization collects. Wampums stores all health records on Canadian servers, applies encryption at rest and in transit, and enforces strict role-based access so only authorized personnel can view a participant's medical information.</p>
        <p>Data retention policies are configurable to match your organization's requirements, and all access to health records is logged for accountability. When a participant ages out or leaves your group, their health data can be purged or exported according to your retention schedule. Wampums is designed to support your PIPEDA obligations from day one.</p>
