    <h1>On-Site Scout Management — Everything You Need During the Meeting</h1>
    <p>The hour before a scout meeting is hectic: attendance to call, points to award, a badge to sign off, a scout needing attention, and a parent asking for a ride update. Wampums puts all of that into one mobile interface that works from your pocket — no laptop required, no paper forms, no internet needed.</p>

    <div class="actions">
      <a class="btn-primary" href="mailto:hello@wampums.app">Request a demo</a>
      <a class="btn-secondary" href="/en/">See all features</a>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Real-Time Attendance — One Tap, Works Offline</h2>
        <p>Open the meeting session and tap each scout's name as they arrive. The roster is pre-loaded from your participant list so there is nothing to set up on the night. Large tap targets work with gloves, the screen is readable in gymnasium lighting, and names are sortable by first name, last name, or subgroup.</p>
        <p>Attendance works entirely offline using optimistic updates — your tap is registered immediately regardless of connectivity. The app shows a sync status indicator so you always know whether your data has been confirmed server-side. For groups of 30 or more, a live search field narrows the list without any scrolling.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Live Points System During Meetings</h2>
        <p>Award points to individual scouts or entire subgroups in real time as activities unfold. The points interface is designed for speed: select participant, choose category, enter value, confirm — all in under five seconds. Leaders running different activity stations can award points simultaneously from their own devices.</p>
        <p>Points feed directly into the cumulative leaderboard and are visible to scouts through the parent and participant portal after the meeting. Categories are customizable — you define what counts as a point in your group's program. Historical point totals are retained, giving scouts a running record across the entire season.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Badge Progress Logging on the Spot</h2>
        <p>When a scout completes a requirement during a meeting, leaders can log that progress immediately from the on-site view rather than writing a note to enter later. Tap the scout's name, select the badge, check off the requirement, and the update is saved. Multiple requirements can be logged in a single session.</p>
        <p>Badge progress logged on-site is immediately visible in the full badge management module, so the record is always current. Leaders do not need to reconcile separate logs after the meeting. When all requirements for a badge are complete, the system flags it for review and award — no tracking spreadsheet needed.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Medication Dispensing During Meetings</h2>
        <p>The on-site module includes incident and wellbeing tracking tools. Leaders see a clear notification when follow-up is needed for a participant during the current meeting. Tapping the alert shows the participant's name and relevant instructions. Confirming the entry logs the event with a timestamp and the leader's name.</p>
        <p>All incident logging done through the on-site module becomes part of the permanent incident log. If connectivity is lost mid-meeting, entry confirmations are queued locally and synced when the connection returns, just like attendance and points. Nothing falls through the gaps because you were in a basement with no signal.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Incident and Note Recording</h2>
        <p>When something happens during a meeting — a minor injury, a behavioural incident, a note about a scout's wellbeing — leaders can record it immediately in the on-site view. Notes are timestamped, associated with the relevant participant, and visible to administrators for follow-up. Voice-to-text input makes recording quick even in a noisy setting.</p>
        <p>Incident records feed into the participant's history, giving group administrators a complete picture over time. Notes can be flagged as requiring follow-up, ensuring nothing is forgotten between meetings. All entries are access-controlled so sensitive notes are visible only to leaders with the appropriate role.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h2>Quick Parent Contact Access</h2>
        <p>When a scout needs to go home early or a parent is late for pickup, leaders need contact information immediately — not after navigating several menus. The on-site contact view shows each participant's primary and secondary emergency contacts with one-tap calling on mobile. Contact details are always cached locally so they are available without internet.</p>
        <p>Contacts are drawn from the participant profile and kept current by parents through the parent portal. Leaders never need to maintain a separate contact sheet or dig through emails to find a phone number. The most critical information during an event is always one tap away, regardless of signal strength.</p>
